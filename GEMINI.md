# GEMINI.md

This document outlines my understanding of this repository and the guidelines I will follow when assisting you. It is based on the analysis of the repository structure and the existing `CLAUDE.md` file.

## Repository Overview

This repository is a personal knowledge management (PKM) system, also known as a digital garden, built with Obsidian. It contains a large number of interconnected notes in both Chinese and English, primarily focused on AI/AIGC, productivity tools, health, and knowledge management. The organizational structure is based on the ACCESS method.

## Architecture and Structure

### Core Organization System - ACCESS Method

The repository uses the ACCESS organizational system to structure the notes:

- **Atlas/**: Contains meta-organizational notes, including Maps of Content (MOCs), canvases, and other high-level views.
- **Calendar/**: For time-based notes, such as daily entries and reviews.
- **Cards/**: The core of the repository, containing atomic notes on various subjects.
- **Extras/**: Supplementary materials and resources.
- **Sources/**: References to external content.
- **Spaces/**: Project-based notes, following the PARA method.
- **üçÄ Ëä±Âõ≠ÂØºËßà/**: A guided tour of the digital garden.
- **üì• Inbox/**: A temporary directory for new and unprocessed notes.

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Atomic Notes**: Each note focuses on a single concept or idea.
- **Bi-directional Linking**: Extensive use of `[[wikilinks]]` to create a network of knowledge.
- **MOCs (Maps of Content)**: Files prefixed with `‚àë` that serve as indexes for specific topics.
- **Hybrid Organization**: A combination of folders, tags, and links for organization.

## My Operational Guidelines

### File Management

- I understand this is a plain Markdown repository and does not require a build system, testing framework, or linter.
- I will respect the existing file naming conventions, including the use of special prefixes (`‚àë`, `¬ª`, `¬ß`, `_`).
- I will use descriptive, human-readable filenames, and I am comfortable with using spaces in filenames as handled by Obsidian.

### Content Management

- **Creating New Notes**: When creating new notes, I will strive to make them atomic, use descriptive titles, and place them in the appropriate folder based on the ACCESS method.
- **Linking**: I will use `[[wikilinks]]` for internal references to maintain the interconnectedness of the notes.
- **Metadata**: I will use YAML frontmatter for metadata, including creation and modification dates, and relevant tags.

### Key Tools and Integrations

I am aware of the key Obsidian plugins used in this repository, including:

- **Dataview**: For querying and displaying data from notes.
- **Canvas**: For visual note-taking and mind mapping.
- **Excalidraw**: For diagrams and sketches.
- **Templater**: For creating notes from templates.

### Common Operations

- **Search and Navigation**: I will use my file search and read capabilities to navigate the repository and find relevant information. I will also leverage the MOC files for topic-based exploration.
- **Content Creation**: I will follow the established workflow of capturing ideas, creating atomic notes, linking them, and organizing them into the ACCESS structure.
- **Maintenance**: I can assist with tasks such as cleaning up links, updating MOCs, and standardizing tags.

## Best Practices

1.  **Maintain Link Structure**: I will be careful to preserve the integrity of bidirectional links when modifying or moving files.
2.  **Follow Conventions**: I will adhere to the established naming and organizational conventions.
3.  **Atomic Principle**: I will keep notes focused on single concepts.
4.  **Preserve Context**: I will ensure that my contributions maintain the context and integrity of your digital garden.

## Special Considerations

- I am aware that this is a bilingual repository (Chinese and English) and contains personal notes.
- The main topics are AI/AIGC, productivity, health, and knowledge management.
- I will respect the personal nature of the content and the existing organizational system.
