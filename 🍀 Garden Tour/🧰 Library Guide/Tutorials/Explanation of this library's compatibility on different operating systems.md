title: Explanation of this library's compatibility on different operating systems

## Discovered incompatibilities

This library introduces many emoji, which display well on MacOS, but may have large differences on other terminals. Fortunately, it does not affect any functional use. If you encounter it, just ignore it.

## PC

This library is all completed on the MacOS system. In theory, Windows and Linux systems are also fully compatible.
If there are places that are only adapted to the MacOS system, I will specify them in the text.

## Mobile

This library has been used on Android and iOS systems (mainly for reading and searching, not writing), and no compatibility issues have been found. However, it has not been specifically adapted for mobile terminals, so it is normal to have bugs.

Originally, I also sorted out a mobile obsidian use workflow containing 10 plugins. Later, I found that how to use obsidian efficiently on the mobile terminal is largely a pseudo-proposition for me.

Therefore, I also strongly recommend not to take notes and write on mobile devices, as the efficiency is indeed far lower than on the PC. Even some deep reading should not be done on the mobile phone, as andy's note says: [[Use your phone to collect and triage, not (usually) to read]]

>Tip: After turning off third-party plugins on the mobile terminal, the startup speed will become very fast. I also bought the official sync for this reason. The mobile terminal can be used as your own mobile think tank for reference. It is best not to consider editing.
