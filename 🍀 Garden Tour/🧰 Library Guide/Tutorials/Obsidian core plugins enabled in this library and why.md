title: Obsidian core plugins enabled in this library and why
publish: true

## Enabled

- Canvas
	- Compared with other whiteboard plugins on the market, the reason we use it is that it can reference its own md files in the obsidian ecosystem.
- Note composer
	- See [[How to merge and combine two quoted pages in obsidian]].
- Tag pane
	- I'm used to writing tags in the [[frontmatter]] area to manage file status and special files. This usage prevents tags from expanding too much and can also work with [[Dataview]].
- Outgoing links
	- Rarely used. But I always feel that something is missing if I don't turn on this function.
- Backlinks
	- Be sure to open it, the essence of [[two-way linked notes]].
	- It is recommended to turn on the option to display in the page. There may be bugs. If it does not appear at the bottom of the page, restart obsidian. Because tools will subtly influence our way of thinking, when this panel appears at the bottom of the page, it will be a strong reminder, so that we can notice which pages have been referenced by the current page, and promote the brain to carry out more connected thinking.
- Workspaces
	- I haven't used it yet because my current work is too easy. I will enable it in the future when my work scene becomes more complicated. [[üçÄ Garden Tour/üß∞ Library Guide/Tutorials/This library's workspace, interface division logic and icons]]
- Graph view
	- I don't usually use it, but opening it and looking at it occasionally can give me some motivation to continue recording.
- Daily notes
	- [[¬ª Daily notes workflow]] is a must. I don't use the community's Calendar plugin and periodic-notes plugin because I almost only care about the current day's note. Of course, if there is a calendar format, it will be more convenient to use, but the Calendar plugin has not been updated for 2 years, and the author has joined the obsidian developer team, so a better calendar core plugin will come sooner or later.
- Search
	- I don't use this plugin very often, but I use it more in pure reading situations. When I usually take notes, in order to use the keyboard more and the mouse less, I more commonly use [[Commonly used shortcut keys and their functions in this library#Core three-piece suit]], which can more conveniently search for resources in the library from various angles.
- File recovery
	- In addition to [[Remotely Save]] and git's several-hour synchronization cycle backup plan, this is the last bumper, and the 5-minute interval can help us retrieve more lost content.
- File explorer
	- Advanced community plugin [[üçÄ Garden Tour/üß∞ Library Guide/Obsidian/Plugins/File Tree Alternative Plugin]].
- Page preview
- Word count

## Plugins that can be replaced

- [[Advanced third-party plugins that replace the core plugins enabled in this library]]

## Not enabled

- Random note
	- I haven't used it yet. [[Active review]] is actually better with [[Spaced Repetition]]. I feel that this random note function is too random, and the rules and results are uncontrollable, so I don't use it.
- Audio recorder
	- Mobile phones, MacOS and Windows all have their own recording software, which can be quickly opened when needed. In addition, using [[Feishu Memo]] and other software that directly supports transcription and translation of recording files, there is no need to use this simple function that can only record.
- Zettelkasten prefixer
	- The native zettelkasten method is like this, but that is the particularity of the paper era. Now it is more practical to directly give the page a file name.
- Slash commands
	- The slash commands supported by Yuque, notion, siyuan, etc. all call text editing related operations, while obsidian calls various system-level or plugin commands, which is very strange in logic, so I turned it off and only use the cmd + p command to call the command palette.
- Starred
	- My [[‚àë This library's ACCESS workflow summary]] determines that the files I follow are either daily notes, recently opened, or #todo tagged files. I rarely need to star a file or search result, so I didn't enable it.
- Markdown format importer
	- If you are not migrating from other two-way linked notes, you will not use this.
