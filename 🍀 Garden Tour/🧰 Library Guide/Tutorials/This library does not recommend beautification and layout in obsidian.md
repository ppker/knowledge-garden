Many friends may be new to [[markdown]]. They will also find that various layout formats that can be easily implemented in word cannot be achieved in markdown. So they start to look for solutions, first adding html to the md file, and then not satisfied, adding css. Finally, they achieve the same layout effect as word, but it takes much more extra time than word.

A not-so-cold-knowledge cold knowledge: the m in html is actually markup. The original intention of using markdown is to let the syntax of the markup format go down, not up. But we choose to use markdown on the one hand, and on the other hand, we try our best to up its markup syntax. Isn't this a very funny thing?

My immature little suggestion is: give up columns, give up indentation, give up various highlights, and give up syntax that markdown does not support. Try to focus your attention on the text content itself. If you can't implement the chemical expression of water in markdown, what's wrong with using H2O to express it? Will you not be able to understand it yourself? Please remember that the first task of notes is to be read by yourself. You don't need to revise it to have no typos and every punctuation mark is accurate.

Another important reason is that if we need to share notes or articles on the Internet ([[Share your thinking results more]]), most platforms support the standard markdown format. When you introduce additional html and css syntax, you will have to spend a lot of time manually adjusting the format on each publishing platform, which is not worth the loss.
