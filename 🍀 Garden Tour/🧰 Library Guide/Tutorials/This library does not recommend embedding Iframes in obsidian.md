title: This library does not recommend embedding Iframes in obsidian

As mentioned in [[This library does not recommend doing too many fancy tricks in obsidian]], using Iframes to embed various web pages into obsidian is actually a kind of fancy trick.

First of all, you should understand that iframe technology is essentially like opening a separate sandbox in obsidian. All operations in this sandbox are independent of your obsidian and the browser installed on your system. The biggest effect it can have is the visual effect, which is as if a certain webpage is directly embedded in your obsidian window, as if it has become a part of your notes.

Other than that, there are only disadvantages.

For example, you cannot enjoy the convenience of various plugins, cookies, and account systems of your system browser. In other words, you even need to perform manual QR code login operations in the iframe of obsidian regularly, but it could have been less troublesome. For example, if you open this page in the browser and use the built-in split-screen function of the system, you can completely achieve the same effect.

Secondly, all interactions between you and the iframe window are not real automated interactions. At most, they are just copy-and-paste interactions. This kind of interaction can be fully achieved by putting the iframe window in the system browser.

A little-known fact: in the past and now, iframe technology is still used by various websites full of junk ads, and it is their "core technology".

In short, I hate and reject all solutions that embed iframes in obsidian.
