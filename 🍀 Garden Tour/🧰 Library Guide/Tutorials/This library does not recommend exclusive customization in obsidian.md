title: This library does not recommend exclusive customization in obsidian
publish: true

The exclusive customization here means that it could have been implemented in a way that is common to the operating system, but another set of implementation methods has to be customized in a certain software, which brings about a sense of fragmentation in the user experience and increases the operating cost of the brain because multiple sets of workflows have to be memorized.

The most common examples are: snippet input, emoji input, current time input, various editing shortcut keys, dictionary query, etc.

Take snippet, emoji or current time input as an example. Outside of obsidian, when we chat with people or browse forums, don't we need to quickly input phrases or emojis? Why should we add extra learning costs to the same need in different scenarios? I currently use the snippet and custom phrase method that comes with [[Sogou Input Method]] to input snippets, emojis and the current time in any input occasion. Unless some chat apps come with richer emoticons, which are different from emojis, it is necessary to spend extra time to learn and adapt.

The same goes for dictionary queries. Some friends may use obsidian's dictionary plugin or even embed a Google Translate page with an iframe to achieve this purpose. The same is to do exclusive customization in obsidian. Isn't the dictionary query function needed in other software? What is worth doing is, for example, using the existing two-way link title in obsidian as a dictionary, so that we can quickly input, query and link to existing pages. This is the exclusive value of obsidian. This function can be implemented through the [[Various Complements]] plugin.

The analysis logic here is similar to [[This library does not recommend embedding Iframes in obsidian]]. [[Occam's razor|Do not multiply entities without necessity]]. Don't be moved by those pseudo-linkages and pseudo-automations that only touch yourself, but actually increase the burden and do not improve efficiency.
