For learning objects with established goals that require a period of time and focus on a single theme, a special project is established under the PARA folder of Spaces for investment. A special case is: if the learning materials of this learning object are in a very single form, for example, all are pdf files, all are text, or all are videos, then they are placed in the Sources folder for learning according to the file type. The purpose of this is that when searching and reviewing in the future, for this kind of learning object with single materials, the type of learning material can be used as a retrieval method, so that we can quickly find the corresponding file. In other words, [[Occam's razor|do not multiply entities without necessity]]. A learning object with single learning materials can probably be completed in a few days, so there is no need to elevate it to the project level. Just like in software development, some functional points are very small and can even be understood as a bug, so there is no need to treat it as a feature and go through the feature development workflow.
