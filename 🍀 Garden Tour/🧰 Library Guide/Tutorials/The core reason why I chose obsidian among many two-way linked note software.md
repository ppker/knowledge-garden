title: The core reason why I chose obsidian among many two-way linked note software
publish: true

The following are the initial reasons for choosing it among many two-way linked note software, that is, the original intention.

- At first glance, it is similar to the [[Spaces/3-Resource/Software-Sorting/macos-software/VSCode]] interface, which gives a sense of familiarity. Of course, the fundamental reason is actually the extremely flexible multi-window support. Multi-window is very convenient and useful in non-fiction writing scenarios. At the same time, referring to multiple notes and their contexts is extremely useful when my writing ideas are stuck.
- The extremely restrained customization of markdown syntax makes it extremely friendly for publishing articles on blogs and other occasions. There is no doubt that other two-way linked notes have either made more customized modifications to the md file itself (logseq), or directly changed to json or database format to store data (siyuan-note). Only obsidian can directly send the md file to the blog website and perfectly support it without modification.
	- Of course, when I first came into contact with it, I didn't realize that this restraint also brought great sacrifices. The fine-grained block reference function could not compete with other two-way linked notes at all. But I have used it so far and have not really felt the necessity of the block reference function. For me, file-level two-way links are enough.
- Large user base and active community. When you encounter problems, you can always find surprises by searching the community, without having to repeatedly step on pits or reinvent the wheel to solve problems. For example, there are markdown format automation plugins, and the [[Various Complements]] plugin for input auto-completion, and so on.
	- Of course, from another perspective, it can also be considered that the over-developed plugin community can also prove the lack and imperfection of some functions of the obsidian body. But I think the obsidian developers have a good grasp of this degree.

Other reasons may also be a part, but they are not as fundamental as these three reasons. I have watched a video that may help you choose which note-taking software to get into: [[ðŸ“¹Reasons for giving up roam and using obsidian]]

After using it for a period of time, I found some shortcomings, and of course, I further discovered some advantages:
