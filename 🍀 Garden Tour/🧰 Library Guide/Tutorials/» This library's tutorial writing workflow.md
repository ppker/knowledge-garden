Question:

- What level of reader is this instruction for, and what does it bring to the reader?
- Am I [[ðŸªžGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime|teaching a man to fish or giving him a fish]]?
- Do I actually use it this way myself? Will I mislead others?

Steps:

- Find inspiration and original materials from [[Â§ This library's obsidian usage manual]].
- Find a suitable place in [[âˆ‘ This library's ACCESS workflow summary]] to insert new links and create new ones.
- Check its position in [[âˆ‘ This library's ACCESS folder entry summary]].
- After writing, follow the instructions to operate it again to supplement any possible remaining details.
- During the writing process, be willing to delete workflows that have been deprecated or are rarely used.
