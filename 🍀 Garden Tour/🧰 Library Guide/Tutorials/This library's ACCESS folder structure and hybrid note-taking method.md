x:: [[Hybrid Note-taking Method]]

- From the content of the note itself:
	- Local and overall. Local is the knowledge point of a certain subdivision, and overall is all the content that you are interested in.
	- [[Top-down]] and [[Bottom-up]]. The former is similar to a mind map, one divides into two, two divides into four, first have a skeleton, then fill in the content. The latter first accumulates isolated knowledge points in a scattered manner, and when it accumulates to a certain extent, it forms a local aggregation, first have the content, then draw the skeleton.
- From the perspective of note organization:
	- [[N xx firsts for organizing notes in obsidian]]

	- [[How to organize and build folders and directories for note-taking]]

	- How to organize and sort?
