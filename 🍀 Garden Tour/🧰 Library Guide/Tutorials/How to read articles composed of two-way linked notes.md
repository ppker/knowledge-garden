>[!TIP] Reading Tips
> - For directory pages and [[âˆ‘ MOCs]] index type pages, it is recommended to keep them resident so that you can return to them at any time:
> 	- If you are browsing this garden in a browser, you can cmd + shift + click the internal link to open a new tab for reading and browsing.
> 	- If you open this library in obsidian, you can use cmd + p + enter "lock" to lock this page, so that when you click the internal link, this page will always be there, so you won't get lost.
> - For ordinary card note pages:
> 	- Try to read without interrupting the [[context]] through mouse hover preview.
> 	- Try to find your way back through the [[backlinks]] at the bottom.

I hope the above tips can prevent you from getting lost quickly after following a lot of link jumps in the garden.
In addition, this is my personal note library, not a systematic article focusing on a certain field. In addition, the messy folder structure on the left and the large number of jump links on the page make you feel messy, which is normal. Please forgive me ðŸ˜….
Therefore, it is strongly not recommended to read these notes according to the folder method on the left. It is not a directory, it is not a directory, it is not a directory.
