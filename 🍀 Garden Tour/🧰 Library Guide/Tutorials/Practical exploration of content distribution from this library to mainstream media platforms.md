title: Practical exploration of content distribution from this library to mainstream media platforms
publish: true
---
I wanted to automate it, but I found it unrealistic. I still feel more secure after previewing the articles published on these platforms. And there is a sense of ceremony when I manually click the publish button. So I didn't spend time exploring the pure automation solutions for these mainstream media platforms.

At present, all the platforms I have used support markdown, which to a certain extent shows the popularity of markdown, and for convenience, do not introduce extended syntax that may not be supported by some platforms. According to the [[GFM - GitHub Flavored Markdown]] standard syntax, all platforms fully support it. After pasting the article, it can be published without any changes.

And note that for these articles to be published, the pictures should be hosted on an image bed, otherwise manually uploading the pictures on each platform will not have a sense of ceremony, but only the feeling of screwing screws.

At present, the md support of each platform I have used is as follows:

| Platform | Support |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| sspai | Perfect support |
| Jianshu | Perfect support |
| Zhubai | Does not support md source code, you need to copy and paste the md in reading mode |
| Yuque | Perfect support |
| Lark | Perfect support |
| notion | Perfect support |
| Zhihu | todo |
| WeChat Official Account | todo |
| csdn | todo |
| obsidian forum | Perfect support |
