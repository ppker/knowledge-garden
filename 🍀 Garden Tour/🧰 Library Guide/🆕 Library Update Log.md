**3O Example Library:**
🎉This is the first official release of version 1.0 after 5 months of trial publication of this library. Many of the previously dug pits have been filled. I named it **3O Example Library**, which means obsidian of oldwinter. oldwiner is my online name 😁.

**What can this library bring you?**
In short, through the tutorials provided in this library, you can gradually familiarize yourself with the power of the note-taking artifact Obsidian, learn how to build your second brain, and learn how to create your digital garden.

**The ultimate goal of this library:**
To become the best practice guide for Chinese users of Obsidian.

**Summary of this library:**
This is both an example library of a second brain based on Obsidian's two-way linked notes, containing 100+ notes on how to use this library. You can follow the instructions to completely reproduce all the effects of this library and this publishing site step by step. At the same time, it is also a digital garden composed of my personal notes, containing 1500+ real notes, which can be used as first-hand reference materials for your practice. How I actually take notes is presented in this library as it is, without any beautification.

**How to use:**
After downloading the zip package and decompressing it, open its root directory directly with your Obsidian. After opening, find "🧰 Library Usage Guide" in the "🧰 Library Guide" folder, and read and practice according to your own situation.

**Update Log:**

- Divided the library into 3 core modules and provided detailed progressive tutorials.
	- How to efficiently use the Obsidian software itself.
	- How to build a personal second brain/knowledge base.
	- How to publish and share your own knowledge base.
- All pictures except those referenced by [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Obsidian/Plugins/Excalidraw]] are hosted on image beds, and all other resources are online. The final library size is reduced to the order of 10MB.
- **Adapted the theme, workflow, and plugin configuration to the latest 1.0 version of Obsidian**. Therefore, if you want to use this library, please **upgrade your Obsidian version to the latest version**.
	- The theme was changed to minimal because its author is the same as the author of the new default theme, so its maturity is very high. The original [[obsidian - shimmering theme]] is not yet mature, and will be considered to be changed back after the author continues to update.
	- Deleted plugins whose core functions have been covered by version 1.0, such as [[Pane Relief]] and [[Outliner]].
	- **Now, even if all third-party plugins are turned off, 95% of the functions can still be used normally.**

**Communication and Discussion**
If you have any questions about this library, please go to [Discussions · oldwinter/knowledge-garden · GitHub](https://github.com/oldwinter/knowledge-garden/discussions) to discuss. I will reply as soon as I see it. I don't have the energy to maintain QQ groups, WeChat groups, etc. I hope for your understanding.

> [!INFO] Tip
> Some adjustments to the usage of this library are updated here.

Writing this is a bit tiring, so I'll hide it for now. I'm considering making it a release version on github in the future and writing update information in commits. The online update version is mainly the update of long articles, and I need to find a way to reflect it, like the recent updates of a blog. #todo/someday

	- [[feature]]
		- cmd + p is changed to use [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Obsidian/Plugins/Better Command Palette]], which supports recently used commands and some more optional configurations, which is closer to the command line experience in vscode.
		- In order to make searching more convenient, the + symbol and emoji symbols are introduced as prefixes for certain types of files. [[» Emoji symbol record of this library's notes]]

	- [[feature]]
		- Finally decided to use [[SimpRead]] to handle web clipping and annotation reading. The configuration is a bit troublesome and there are constant small bugs, but it is still good to use after it is done. [[Using SimpRead for progressive summarization of web articles]]. I am especially afraid that cloud-based things like [[Cubox]] may also be subject to supervision and delete my clippings in the future. Moreover, the problem of how to quote the clippings and annotations from cubox in obsidian has not been solved well, which makes it not easy to use.
		- Use a little html syntax to beautify [[README]]. According to the analysis of [[Update frequency of digital gardens, traditional blogs, and newsletters]], I decided to introduce [[newsletter]] at a frequency of about 2 articles per month.

	- [[feature]]
		- cmd + o is changed to use [[Another Quick Switcher]], which is more powerful.
		- Changed the Spaces folder of [[ACCESS Note Organization Method]] and designed it as [[PARA]].
	- [[improvement]]
		- Delete the display of personal WeChat. It's a waste of time to pull WeChat groups. Whoever wants to do it can do it.
		- Organize all daily logs for June

	- [[feature]]
		- Obsidian was upgraded to version 0.15, which supports popping up a separate window, so useless plugins were deleted.
	- [[improvement]]
		- Added [[Recommended obsidian introductory route and resources for this library]] to prevent novices from wasting too much time in this library.

	- [[feature]]
		- Introduced the svg image of [[Spaces/0-Work/Cards/excalibrain]]

	- [[improvement]]
		- Adjusted the default page for online browsing to [[AboutTheGarden]] to relieve the reading burden of new readers. The default page of the source code repository is still [[README]].

	- [[feature]]
		- Added the [[🗜 How to Use Productivity Tools]] menu
	- [[improvement]]
		- Reorganized [[frontmatter]], currently only retaining the regular title and date.
		- Reorganized the folder distribution. Since the link url of the [[obsidian publish]] page is unstable, the folder and file name need to be fixed to prevent others from quoting relevant pages of this library from becoming invalid.
		- Beautified the layout of the [[🍀 Garden Tour]] related pages and added emoji support.

	- [[feature]]
		- Initially completed the [[🍀 Garden Tour]] page.
		- Completed the course study notes of [[§ How to Become a Learning Master - Gao Leng Leng]].
